#### 
At the Ditto API there are different ways for getting notified of such events:

- Via the WebSocket API a WebSocket client gets all Events the authenticated subject (e.g. a user) is authorized to receive as Ditto Protocol messages.
- Via HTTP SSEs a consumer of the SSE EventSource gets all Events the authenticated subject (e.g. a user) is authorized to receive directly in the format of the changed entity (e.g. as Thing JSON format).
- Via an established connection in the connectivity service

## Server sent events
This is a mechanism to get change notifications. The benefit of this mechanism in comparison to the WebSocket channel is, that it is even easier to open a SSE connection from the client than a WebSocket, and that in Dittoâ€™s interpretation of SSEs the events sent back from the backend have the same JSON structure as the HTTP API on which they are invoked.

When the endpoint is invoked with an HTTP header Accept with value text/event-stream, a Server-Sent Event stream of change notifications is created by Ditto and for each notification for which the caller has READ permissions (see authorization), an event is sent to the client.

The format of the event at the /things endpoint is always in the form of a Thing JSON.

For partial updates to a Thing however, only the changed part is sent back via the SSE, not the complete Thing.

Only get notified about specific changes
In order to apply a server side filtering of which Server-Sent Events should be emitted to a consumer, Ditto provides several possibilities listed in the sections below.

All of the query parameters below can be combined, so that you can for example express that only events from a certain namespace with a specific RQL expression should be emitted, which could look like:
        http://localhost:8080/api/2/things?namespaces=org.eclipse.ditto.one,org.eclipse.test&filter=gt
        (attributes/counter,42)
#### Server-Sent Events are unidirectional originating from the back-end towards the client. Via SSEs the client can only be notified, it cannot send data back (it can use plain HTTP for that).

For a detailed introduction into SSEs, please visit the [HTML5 specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html).
